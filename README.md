Hi, I’m a beginner MERN stack developer with a background in mechanical engineering and a growing passion for full-stack web development. I recently started my journey by learning Figma, where I design clean and user-friendly UI/UX layouts before turning them into real-world applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This repository showcases my learning progress, including responsive web apps, authentication systems, REST APIs, and UI prototypes transformed from Figma designs into fully functional MERN projects. My goal is to continuously improve my development skills by building practical, scalable, and well-structured applications while documenting everything I learn along the way.Reach me:hemanthgowdar444@gmail.com
